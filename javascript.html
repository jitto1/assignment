            <p><i> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                 conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
                  compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                   object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                [10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating
                 third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
                  execute the code on the user's device.<br>
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                 programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                  dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,
                 or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
                  JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br>
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are
                 now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variet
                 y of applications.</i></p>
